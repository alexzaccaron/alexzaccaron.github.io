title: "Powdery mildew fungi have atypical sterol pathway"
---


## Background

Ergosterol is a vital component of fungal cell membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining membrane fluidity, permeability, and the proper functioning of membrane-associated proteins. The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway is essential for fungal growth and survival, making it a prime target for antifungal drugs, i.e., sterol biosynthesis inhibitors.




## Major findings
Interestingly, the grape powdery mildew pathogen Erysiphe necator does not have the last two genes, ERG4 and ERG5, of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. This likely explains previous reports of abnormal sterol composition in powdery mildew fungi. Istead of Ergosterol, their main sterol is 24-methylene cholesterol. I proposed that a homolog of DHCR7, involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in animals, is involved in 24-methylene cholesterol biosynthesis.
