I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Weisberg](https://weisberglab.com) and [LeBoldus](https://bpp.oregonstate.edu/users/jared-leboldus) in the Botany and Plant Pathology department at Oregon State University. My research focus on comparative genomics analyses of fungal plant pathogens. Using bioinformatics techniques, I am interested in exploring changes in genome organization and molecular mechanisms of adapation of fungal plant pathogens. I particular, I seek answers to questions related to "how pathogens evolve to overcome host resistance?"

My academic journey is quite unique. I earned a BS in Computer Science from the State University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Following this, I completed my MS in Computer Science at the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. During my master's, I delved into computational complexity and combinatorial optimization, focusing on a theoretical problem called [the maximum similarity partitioning problem](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJICA.2016.078727). I demonstrated that this problem is NP-complete in the strong sense and proposed greedy heuristics to address it.

For my PhD, I took a drastic turn. I earned my PhD in [Integrative Genetics and Genomics](https://igg.ucdavis.edu) at UC Davis, working in the [Stergiopoulos](https://caes.ucdavis.edu/people/ioannis-stergiopoulos) lab. My doctoral research centered on investigating the genome organization and structural variations that influence the evolution of fungal pathogens, specifically the tomato pathogen *Cladosporium fulvum* and the grape powdery mildew pathogen *Erysiphe necator*.

## My research

In my current research, I continue to investigate how the genome of fungal plant pathogen evolve, allowing them to rapid adapt to adverse conditions. Notably, I use comparative genomics of to investigate how strains of the Eastern Filbert Blight pathogen *Anisogramma anomala* are capable to overcome resistance in hazelnut, particularly the 'Gasaway' resistance. I also investigate how chromosome structural variations affect the genome of another fungus, the poplar tree pathogen *Sphaerulina musiva*.



To assist in my research, I use a great variety of computational tools. Often, I integrate these tools to build bioinformatics workflows based on [Snakemake](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io).
