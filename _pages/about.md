I am a PhD candidate in the Integrative Genetics and Genomics group at UC Davis. I am passionate about using bioinformatics and data analysis to guide and facilitate functional studies that lead to new biological insights.

## My research
My focus is on comparative genomics analyses of fungal plant pathogens. Using next generation sequencing data and genomics data, I am interested in finding mutations and changes in the genome architecture that can mediate adaptation of fungal pathogens, particularly in the context of virulence and fungicide resistance.



I use a great variety of computational tools to conduct my research. Often, I integrate these tools to build bioinformatics workflows based on [Snakemake](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io).
