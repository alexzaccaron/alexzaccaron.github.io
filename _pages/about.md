I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Weisberg](https://weisberglab.com) and [LeBoldus](https://bpp.oregonstate.edu/users/jared-leboldus) labs at Oregon State University. My research focus on comparative genomics analyses of fungal plant pathogens. Using bioinformatics techniques, I am interested in exploring changes in genome organization and molecular mechanisms of adapation of fungal plant pathogens. I particular, I seek answers questions related to "how pathogens evolve to overcome host resistance?"

## My research

In my current research, I investigate the genome of the Eastern Filbert Blight pathogen *Anisogramma anomala* to identify mutations that allow the pathogen to overcome resistance in hazelnut, particularly the 'Gasaway' resistance.


I also investigate how chromosome structural variations affect the genome of the poplar tree pathogen *Sphaerulina musiva*.



To assist in my research, I use a great variety of computational tools. Often, I integrate these tools to build bioinformatics workflows based on [Snakemake](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io).
